# hello-world12
Hello World 12 the last one I'm gonna make.
  
  -I want to allow the player to interact with everthing, each item will have a set of properties that can be expiremented with.
Learning how to keep track of mass amount of objects each with different atributes would be helpful.
Example. Breath of the Wild or Terraria.
I also want to have the contols of my games to feel natural. So that the player can pick up the controls and allow for a great sense of mastery without all the practice.
  
  -Learning the play test properly would help but also learning how to automate some of the controls or allow for some exception when excuting the commands.
Example Celeste (gives the player a short window of opportunity to jump even if they are mid air) Ori and the will of the wisps (Ori has a range of motions and each feels just as smooths and the last).
